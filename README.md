# GCI-Unit-Converter

# Description
I developed this unit converter app for the open source organisation CCExtractorDevelopment, as part of a series of tasks in Google Code In 2019.

This is a unit converter that can convert between units for several kinds of quantities, including distance, mass, time and current. It supports both metric and imperial units.
It uses a text based conversion table to perform conversions, meaning that new units can be added just by adding to the table. It supports a graphical interface for intuitive
controls to convert between units, and it also supports a command line interface for more advanced features including user customisable units, and advanced units involving multiple
quantities (e.g. metres/second to kilometres/hour).

Simply run 'Unit Converter GUI.py' to open the app. You can then click 'Switch to CLI for more advanced features' if you prefer the command line interface.
